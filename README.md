This is the next revision of nolotiro.org (v3), this time in [Ruby On Rails].

* Ruby: 2.3
* Rails: 4.2
* MySQL: 5.6

## Automatic Installation

You need to install [VirtualBox] and [Vagrant]. Then from the root directory of
the project, execute

```
vagrant up
 ```

When finished, you need to log in to the virtual machine with the command

```
vagrant ssh

```

Finally you should start the application server

```
cd /vagrant
bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```

Now you can access the web application at this URL

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Manual Installation

Check out the script in `bin/bootstrap.sh` - that's the same that Vagrant uses.

## Test setup

Running `bin/rake` will run all the tests, that should always pass on a freshly
downloaded copy a nolotiro's master.

Some of our integration tests use `poltergeist` + `phantomjs` to run against a
real headless browser. Currently, because of [this bug][Phantomjs Bug] and
[this bug][Travis Bug] we are providing the phantomjs's linux x86_64 binary
within the repo itself.

## More information

For obtaining geographical information we use [Yahoo YQL].

For IP GeoLocation we use [GeoLite2] City. To download the database, run

```
bin/rake download_maxmind_db
```

For delayed tasks, we use Sidekiq, that uses Redis. For caching, we use Redis.

```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
bundle exec sidekiq
```

For recaptcha you need to [signup][Google Recaptcha] and configure it in the
relevant environment in *config/secrets.yml* (keys *recaptcha.public_key* and
*recaptcha.private_key*)

## Development environment magic

For the emails we recommend using mailcatcher. This doesn't send external emails
during development, and you can see them in a nice web interface. The SMTP port
is already configured.

```
bin/mailcatcher
open http://localhost:1080
```

Happy hacking!

## i18n

For the localization and translation interface we use [LocaleApp].
